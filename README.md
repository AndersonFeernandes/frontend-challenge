# Greentech Challenge
Greentech Challenge is a platform for sustainable startups and investors. Startups can apply and go through one week of preparation to pitch their idea to investors. Our digital platform is enriching our service with a matching algorithm and automated emails to bring startups and investors together. 

## About the challenge

This is a pretty simple test, in which you should be able to write a React app, using the provided screens as reference. Youâ€™ll need to make requests to the Google API to get address suggestions.

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer, but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favourite tools and packages to build a solid React application.

### The app should be signup with a success page:

* **Signup:** Input forms;

  _Think about inline validation, error messages, floating labels and loading state_

* **Success:** Thank you page;

  _Think about dynamic data and go back and edit function_

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your HTML, CSS, Javascript and React API skills and overall approach while composing a simple web app given a set of screens and an API feed. We will also assess the HTML, CSS, and JS output.

## Getting Started

1.  Fork this repository to your personal account;
2.  Create a branch with your name;
3.  Solve the challenge in the best way you can;

**Send us your code in one of two ways.**

1.  Send us a PR;
2.  Send us an email with your code in a zip to: jan@greentechchallenge.eu

### Tips

* Write a good README with basic information (e.g.: how to start the project and how to build it);
* There's no screens designed for the mobile version, but if you build a responsive app it's a big plus. We would love to see your design skills as well (no styleguide yet!)
* Feel free to work and improve on the available designs. Think of them as guidelines.
* Prefer to use css instead of jquery for the floating labels #titanic { float: none; }
* Ask questions when in doubt
* We're looking for signs you understand concepts such as events, promises, and reactivity, and how those concepts are implemented in Javascript;
* Unit testing will be greatly valued;
* The git history will be evaluated;
* Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, elegance (among other factors);
